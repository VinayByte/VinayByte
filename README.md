# Hey there, I'm Vinay Kumar! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Android Engineer with an optional brain. ðŸ˜„ I speak Kotlin fluently, and my Compose skills are so smooth, they'll make your UI sing. I am seeking better opportunities in the Android/Automotive/AOSP domain.

## About Me
- Fluent in Java, Kotlin, and Android. However, Java occasionally gives me the silent treatment. ðŸ˜„
